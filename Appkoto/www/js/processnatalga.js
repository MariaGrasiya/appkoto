And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. and he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything."
                            But when he came to himself, he said,"How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him,"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as your hired servants." And he arose and came to his father. But while he is still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him,"Father,I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son", But the father told to his servants,"Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his foot. and bring the fatenned calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead. and is alive again; He was lost and is found".

And he called one of the servants and askes what these things meant. And he said to him,"Your brother has come, and your father killed the fattened calf, because he has recieved him back safe and sound," But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, but he answered his father,"Look this many years I have serve you, and never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, That I might celebrtae with my friends," But when this son of yours came,who has devoured  your property with prostitutes, you kiled the fattened calf for him! And he said to him,"Son, you are always with me and all tat is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found"</li>

    <li>"It seems a young aspirant to holiness once came to visit the hermitage of an old holy man who was sitting in the doorway of his quarters at sunset. The old man's dog stretched out across the threshold as the young spiritual seeker presented his problem to the holy man."Why is it, Abba, that some who seek God come to the desert and are zealous in prayer but leave after a year or so, while others, like you, remain faithful to the quest for a lifetime?".
The old man smiled snd replied,"let me tell you a story:
"One day I was sitting here quietly in the sun with my dog. Suddenly, a large white rabbt ran across in front of us. We'll, my dog jumped up, barking loudly, and took off after that big rabbit. Soon, other dogs jin him, attracted by hid barking. What a sight it was, as the pack of dogs ran barking across the creeks, up stony embankments and through thickets and thorns! Gradually. however, one by one, the other dogs dropped out of the pursuit, discouraged by the course and frustrated by the chase. Only my dog continued to hotly pursue the white rabbit." 
"In that story, young man, is the answer to your question".
The young man sat in confused silence. Finally, he said,"Abba, I dont understand. what is the connection between the rabbit chase and the quest for holiness?"
"You fail to understand,"answered the old hermit,"because you failed to ask the obvious question. Why didn't the other dogs continue on the chase? And the answer to that question is that they had not seen the rabbit Unless you see your prey, the chase is just too difficult. You will lack the passion and the determination necessary to perform all the hard work required by the discipline your spiritual exercise."</li>

    <ul>
    <li>On one ocassion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus."Teacher", he asked," What must I do to enherit eternal life?"." What is written in the law?", he replied," How do you read it?", he answered: " Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with yall your soul  and with all your strenght and with all your mind; and,"Love your neighbor as yourself." " You have answered correctly", Jesus replied: " Do this af you will live." But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus," "And who is my neighbor?"  In reply Jesus said: " a man was going down from Jerusalem to jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw  the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed ny on the other side. But a Samritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring an oil and wine. Then he put the man on his donkey, took him on an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. "Look after him," he said, " and when I return, I will reimburse you or any extra expense you may have," " Which of this three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?" The expert in the law replied, " The one who had mercy on him."
Jesus told him," Go and do likewise.</li>

"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The richman also died and was buried. In hades , whre he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him," Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire".
"But Abraham replied," son, remember that in your lifetime you recieved your good things, while Lazarus recieved bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot , nor can anyone cross over from there to us."
"He answered," Then I beg you, father,send lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to his place of torment.
"Abraham replied," They have Moses and the prophets; Let them listen to them".
"No father Abraham," he said,"but  if someonefrom the dead goes to them,they will repent."

<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables,saying:" A farmer went out to sow his seed. as he was scattering the seed,some feel along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. some fell on rocky places,where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly,because the soil was shallow. but when the sun came up,the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns,which grew up and choed the plants.Still other seed fell on good soil,where it produced a crop-a hundred,sixty or thirty times what was sown.Whoever has ears,let them hear."
The discipline came to him and asked," why do you speak to the people in parables?".
He replied," Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you,but not to them. Whoever has will be given more,and they will have an abundance.Whoever does not have,even what they have will be taken from them.This is why I apeak to them in parables:
"Though seeing,they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand."In them  is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:
"You will be ver hearing but never understanding; You will be ever seeing but never percieving. For this people's heart has become calloused; They hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes,understand with their hearts and turn and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear you hear but did not hear it.
"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means : When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the words and at once recieves it with joy. But since they have no root , they last only a short time. when trouble or persecution come because of the word,they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word,but worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choked the word,making it unfruitful. but the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understand it. This is the one hundred,sixty or thirty times was sown ."</li>

"Then the steward said within himself,"What shall I do?,For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg. I have resolved what to do, That when I put out of the stewardship, they may recieve me into their houses"
"So he called everyone of his master's debtors to him, and said to the first," How much do you owe my master?" And he said,"A hundred measures of oil." So he said to him,"Take your bill, and sit down quicky and write fifty." Then he said to another , And how much do you owe ?" So he said," A hundred measures of wheat." And he said to him," take your bill,and write eighty." So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in thier generation than the sons of light
"And I say to you,make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you fail, they may recieve you into an everlasting home. He whom is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much. Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,who will commit to your trust the true riches?. and if you have not been faithful in what is another man's , who will give you what is your own?"
"No servant can serve two masters;for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."

<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>The third part of the discussion around this very eventful meal involved the telling of the parable.Jesus rebuking was making some of the guests nervous, so someone on the table pronounced the blessing on those who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God. Surely it will be a great day when etrnal fellowship with God comes. No doubt the person who speaks  up thinks that all at the table will agree with this blessings. But Jesus takes even this occasion to issue yet another warning through a parable. In effect, he says," Don't count your chickens before they hatch. and don't count your blessings to early. There will be surprises at god's banquet table."The parable revolves around a man's to a grand occasion, a great banquet. In the ancient world such a meal  would have been preceded by invitations,which would have been accepted by those planning to attend ,musch like our RSVP. The next step was to hear from the host's servant that the meal was ready , which is exactly what happens in verse 17.
"So he called everyone of his master's debtors to him, and said to the first," How much do you owe my master? And he said,"A hundred measures of oil." So he said to him,"Take your bill, and sit down quicky and write fifty." Then he said to another , And how much do you owe ?" So he said," A hundred measures of wheat." And he said to him," take your bill,and write eighty." So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in thier generation than the sons of light.
But surprising thing happens on the way to the dinner. last-second refusals puor in,despite the RSVP's.A the text says, they all alike began to make excuses. Jesus notes three particular.
The first excuse involves the need to check out  a recently bought field.Some ancient purchases did require a postpurchase inspection. So the excuse is a culturally natural one, but it also reveals priorities: something else is more important than this celebration.
The second excuse involves the purchase of five oxen. Since most ancient landowners had only one or two oxen. This man is clearly wealthy by ancient standards. Ofcourse the reaction again reflects priorities,
The third excuse involves recent marriage and the desire to spend time with the new bride. The Old testament allowed one to be freed from certain obligation in case of marriage. But it is hard to see why this would be sufficient reason to keep the man from attending this party,especially since he had already accepted the invitation. Again, he is choosing other priorities.
The servant tells the masters of the refusals. The master decides, however, that his party will go on anyway.Nothing is to be delayed.

"Then he sent some more servants snd said,"Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have ben butchered, and everything is ready.Come on the wedding banquet.".But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his farm,another to his business.

<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard," Look for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground? But he answered and said to him," Sir,let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. And if it bears fruits,well.But if not , after that you can cut it down.
Fruit trees require a lot of care and proper handling to continue producing luscious fruit year in and year out. It's rewarding to see a tree bending under the weight of apples,pears,oranges or grapefruit. To go into your backyard and pick your own fruit you watched develop and ripen is both instructive and rewarding
Its instructive in that we see how fruit develops on a tree. we see the bloom appear and then the first buds of the fruit begin to grow and develop through the months. Seeing the process teaches more than we learn by going to the market and buying the fruit off the stand. Fruit does'nt just appear in the grocery store; It take time and care to nurture and develop
It's rewarding to take part in the process by which fruits grows.Your efforts combine with the work of nature to bring fruit to harvest.
The harvest of ripened friut is the reason the tree is takng up valuable real estate. Satisfaction is so important in this process that when there is no fruit you stand looking at the tree trying to understand why it has borne no fruit.I've stood looking at barren trees ad asked myself the same question.Before delving further in to the parable , we need to look at the Christ was saying before he gave it to us.</li>

He packed all the other chicks into submissions. He lorded it over all the others. This he continued to do when he became a rooster.
He nit only pecked the other chickens. He also attacked them with his spurs umtil the others were blooded and fled away.The rooster did not even allow the other cocks to crow. In the morning, he alone announced the start of the new day or the setting of the sun.During the feeding time, he satiated himself first before letting the others to eat his leftovers.At night, he perched on the highest branch of tree. The others with the lower levels.Unfortunately, The rooster grew bigger than the rest. He even became more domineering and aggressive. Attempts to fight him wre disastrous and futile. He sent all the challengers fleeing for their lives.
After lording it over the whole poultry, he turned his attention to the other animals. So he became bullied the dogs and the cats. Because of his wings ,he swooped into the canines and felines from behind. His beaks and spurs scared those that presented a semblance of resistance.
Then the rooster challenged the goats. They were docile and even more easy to dominate .He flew and landed at the back of the carabao," I am taller than you," the rooster said." Now  am your master. You must do my bidding. I command you to parade me around." The carabao ambled about as though to herald the Lord of the domisticated animal kingdom".
But the rooster was not satisfied. he successful triumphs over the other animals emboldened him. he wanted total dominance.
"Since I now control all the animals in this land," the rooster proclaimed," I will now control man. They to will be under my command."
With that, the rooster attacked the first woman who passed by. But it was not too easy. For the woman quickly grabbed him in the neck. No matter how strongly he wriggled his body and flapped its wings, the woman's grip only got tighter. Not only that, the more he moved, the more pain he felt on his neck.
The woman marched directly to her kitchen and before the rooster knew what was happening, His heas was chopped off.
That evening, the Lord of all pary of a steaning tinola.</li>

Most prophets focused on the audience all the things they had done wrong. In contrast, Hosea shind the spotligth on God.How must God feel when his chosen pople reject him and go panting after false Gods?
As if words are too weak to convey his passion, God asked the rave Hosea to act out a living parable.Hosea married a loose womannamed Gomer,who,true to form,quickly ran away and committed adultery. Only by living out this drama could Hosea understand, and than express,something of how God felt concerning Israel's rebuff of his affections.Poor Hosea lived a soap opera-like existence. Gomer sank so slow as to sell herself into slavery, But Hosea purchased her back, forgave her and reclaimed her as his wife. The pattern hopelessly repeated itself.Gomer bore three children-but was Hosea really their father? According to the law, he should have turned his adulterous wife out on the street or had her tried in court. What Hosea did- and what God did was unprecendented.</li>

A big crowd had gathered around the tower to see the race and cheer on the contestant. The race began..

honestly: No one in the crowd really believed that the tiny frogs would reach the top of the tower. you heard statements such as:"Oh, way too difficult!".They wil never make it to the top." Not a cance that they will succeed." the tower is too high!".

The tiny frigs began collapsing . One by one ..Except for those, who kept a fresh tempo and kept climbing higher and higher.

The crowd continue to yell,"It is too difficult!" No one will make it !.More tiny frogs got tired and gave up..

But one continued higher and higher and higher..This one wouldn't give up!

At the end everyone else had given up climbing the tower. Except for the one iny frog who, after a big effort, was the only one who reached the top!

All the other tiny frogs naturally wanted to know how this one managed to do it. A contestant asked the tiny frog how he had found the strength to succeed and reach the goal!

It turned out..the winner is a deaf. The wisdom of this story is: Never listen to other's people tendencies to be negative or pessimistic.. They take your most wonderful dreams and wishes away from you if you let them-the ones you have in you heart!</li>

Then who had recieved the one talent came and said,"Lord, I knew you to be a hard man,Reaping where you have not sown,and gathering where you have not scattered seed.And I was afraid, and went  and hid your talent in the ground.Look,there you have what is yours"

"But his Lord answered and said to him,"You wicked and lazy servant,you knew that I reap where I have not sown,and gather where I have not scatteres seed. So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have recieved back my own interest. Therefore take the talent from him,and give it to him who has ten talents.</li>

    <li>A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard," Look for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground? But he answered and said to him," Sir,let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. And if it bears fruits,well.But if not , after that you can cut it down.

Fruit trees require a lot of care and proper handling to continue producing luscious fruit year in and year out. It's rewarding to see a tree bending under the weight of apples,pears,oranges or grapefruit. To go into your backyard and pick your own fruit you watched develop and ripen is both instructive and rewarding

Its instructive in that we see how fruit develops on a tree. we see the bloom appear and then the first buds of the fruit begin to grow and develop through the months. Seeing the process teaches more than we learn by going to the market and buying the fruit off the stand. Fruit does'nt just appear in the grocery store; It take time and care to nurture and develop

It's rewarding to take part in the process by which fruits grows.Your efforts combine with the work of nature to bring fruit to harvest.

The harvest of ripened friut is the reason the tree is takng up valuable real estate. Satisfaction is so important in this process that when there is no fruit you stand looking at the tree trying to understand why it has borne no fruit.I've stood looking at barren trees ad asked myself the same question.Before delving further in to the parable , we need to look at the Christ was saying before he gave it to us.</li>

Since he was not able to pay , the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and that he had be sold to repay the debt.
The servant fell on his knees before him."Be patient with me." he begged, " And I will pay back everything."The servants master took pity on him,canceled the debt and let him go.
But when the servant went out, He found one og his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. Pay back what I owe me!. he demanded." His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,"Be patient with me, and I will pay you back."
But he refused. Instead. he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what happened,they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened."Then the master called he servant in. You wicked sservant," he said, I cancelled all the debt of yours you negged me too.

Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and could go no father.
Then the man decided to help the butterfly, So he took a pair of scissors and snipped ogg the remaining bit of the coccon. The butteryfly the emerged easily.But it had swollen body and small.shriveled wings.
The man continued to watch the butterfly because he expected that,at moment,the wings would enarge and expand to be able to support the body which would contract in time.
Niether happened!In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crwaling around with swollen body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly.
What this man i his kindness and haste did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required to the butterfly to get through the tiny opening wera natures way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into wings so that it would be ready for fight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon.
Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If nature allowed us to go through your life without any obstacles.it would cripple us.We would not be as strong as what we could have been. And we could never fly.</li>

        <b class="n">Parable of the Four Wives</b></center>
<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>Once upon a time , There was a rich merchant who had 4 wives.He loved the 4th wife the most and adorned her with rich robes and treated her to delicacies. He took great care of her and gave her nothing but the best.
he also loved the 3rd wife very much. he's very proud of her and always wanted to show off her to his friends. However, the merchant is always in fear that she might run away with some other men.
He too,loved his 2nd wife. She is very cnsiderate person, always patient ad infact is the merchamts confidante. Whenever the merchant  faced some problems, he always turned to his 2nd wife. She would always help him out ad tide him through difficult times. Now, the merchants 1st wife is very loyal partner and has made great contributions in maintaining his wealth and business as well taking care of the hosehold. However, the merchant did not loe the 1st wife and although she love him deepl, he hardly took notice of her
One day,the merchant fell ill.Before long,he knew that he was ging to die soon. He thought of his luxurious life and tild himself," Now I have 4 wives with me. But when I die, I would be alone . How lonely I would be!"
Thus, he asked the 4th wife," I loved you ,ost endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?"
"No way!", replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another word. Answer cut like a sharp knife right into the merchamt's heart.
The sad merchant then asked the 3rd wife," I have loved you so much for all my life. Now that I'm dying, wil you follow me and keep me company? " 
No! replied the third wife. Life is so good over here! I'm going to remarry when you die! The Merchant's heart sank and turned cold.

He then ask the second wife, I always turned to you for help and you've always help me out. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?

I'm sorry, I cant help you out this time! Replied the 2nd wife, at the very most I can always send you to your grave. Answer came like a volt of thunder and was devastated. Then a voice, called out. I'll leave with you I will follow where you go.

The merchant look up, and there was the first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered from malnutrition. Waitly grieved, the Merchant's said, I should have taken much better care of you while I could help.  

Actually, we all have four lives in our life. Among the four wives, the fourth wife is our body, no matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good. I would leave us when we die. Our third wife is our possesion, status and wealth. When we die, they all go to others. The second wife is our family and friends, no matter how close they have been there for us when were alive, the farthest they can stay by us is up to the grave. The first is infact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material wealth and sensual pleasures.</li>

        <b class="n">Parable of the Boy and the Apple Tree</b></center>
<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree. A little boy loved to come and play around it everyday. He climbed to the tree top, ate the apples and took a nap under the shadow. He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him. Time went by. The little boy had grown up and he now longer played around the tree everyday.

One day the boy came back to the tree and he looked sad. "Come and play with me".the tree asked the boy.

I am no longer a kid. I do not play around trees any more," the boy replied." I want toys. I nees money to buy them."

Sorry..but I do not have money,but you can pick all my apples and sell them. So,you will have money.

The boy was so excited. He grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily. The boy never came back after he picked the apples.

The tree was sad.One day the boy who now turned into a man returned and the tree was excited.Come and play with me," The tree said".

I do not have time to play. I have to worj for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?

Sorry..but I don't have a house. But you can chop off my branches to build your house.

So the man cut all the branches of the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the man never came back since then. The tree was again lonely and sad.

One hot summer day,the man returned and the tree was delighted." Come and paly with me"the tree said." I am getting old. I want to go sailing to relax myself can you give me boat," said the man.

Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy. So the man cut the tree to make a boat. He went sailing and never showed up for along time.

Finally,the man returned after many years. Sorry,my boy. But I do not have anything for you anymore. No more apples for you, The tree said.

No problem, I do not have any teeth to bite ,the man replied

No more trunkfor you to climb on. I am too old for that now. the man said.
I really cannot give you anything, the only thing left is my dying roots, the tree said with tears.
I don't need much now,just a place to rest . I am tired after all these years," the man replied.

"Good! Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest come and sit down with me and rest.

The man sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears. 

This is a story of everyone. The tree is like our parents. When we we young, we loved to play with our Mum and Dad. When we grow up, we leave them.. only come to them when we need something or when we are in trouble. No matter what, parents will always be there and give everything the could just to make you happy.</li>

        <b class="n">Parable of the Crystal Ball</b></center>
<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>In the South of Spain,there was a small village whose people were very joyful and lucky. The children played under the shade of trees in the gardens of their home.A shepherd boy whose name was Nasir stayed near the village with his father ,mother and grandmother.Early in the morning each day, he takes his herd of goats up the hills to find a suitable place for them to graze. In the afternoon he would return with them o the village. At night his grandmother would tell him a story. The story of stars. This story really interested Nasir. As usual, on one of these days as Nasir was watching  his herd and playing his flute he suddenly saw a wonderful light behind the flower bush. When he came towards the branches he saw a transparent and most beautiful cystal ball.
The cystal ball was glittering like a colorful rainbow. Nasir carefully took it in his hand and turned it around. With surprise suddenly he heard a weak voice coming from crystal ball. It said, "You can make a wish that your heart desires and I will fulfill it."Nasir could not believe that he had actually heard a voice. But he became so engrossed in his thoughts for he had so many wishes but he must wish for something which was impossible like the wish to be able to fly. He said to himself, “if I wait till tomorrow I will remember many things." 
He put the crystal ball in a bag and gathered the herd, happily returned back to the village. He decided that he would not tell anyone about the crystal ball.On the following day also, Nasir could not decide what to wish for, because he really had everything he needed. The days passed as usual and Nasir appeared to be very cheerful that the people around him were amazed to see his cheerful disposition.One day a boy followed Nasir and his herd and hid behind a tree. Nasir as usual sat in one corner, took out the crystal ball and for a few moments looked at it. The boy waited for the moment when Nasir would go to sleep. Then he took the crystal ball and ran away. When he arrived in the village, he called all the people and showed them the crystal ball. The citizens of that tillage took the crystal ball in their hand and turned it around with surprise.Suddenly they heard a voice from inside the crystal ball, which says, 'I can fulfill YOUR wish."One person took the ball and screamed, "I want one bag full of gold." Another took the ball and said loudly, 1 want two chest full of jewelry." Some of them wished that they would have their own palace with grand door made from pure gold instead of their old houses. Some also wished for bags full of jewelry, but nobody asked for gardens in their palaces. All their wishes were fulfilled but still the citizens of the village were not happy. They were jealous because the person that had a palace had no gold and the person that had the gold had no palace. For this reason, the citizens of the village were angry and were not speaking to each other. There was not even one garden which existed in the village where the children could play. The patience of the children was running out and they were uncomfortable.Nasir and his family were happy and pleased. Every morning and afternoon he would play the flute. The children could not wait anymore and decided to return the crystal ball to Nasir. The parents and neighbors went to him.The children said to Nasir, "When we had a small village we all were happy and joyful." The parent also spoke. In one way or another nobody is happy. The expensive palaces and jewelry only bring us pain. When Nasir saw that the people were really regretful, he said I have not wished till now, if you really want everything to return to its own place, then I will wish for it. Everyone happily agreed. Nasir took the crystal ball in his hand turned around and wished that the village become the same as it was before. Everyone quickly turned towards the village and saw it became the same old village with gardens full of trees and fruits.Once again the people started to live happily and the children played under the shade of trees. From the next day and everyday at sunset the sound of Nasir's flute could be heard in the village.This story teaches us that we should be happy with whatever we have and not to be greedy.</li>

<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>One cold, frosty day in the middle of winter a colony of ants was busy drying out some grains of corn which had grown damp during the wet autumn weather. 

A grasshopper half dead with cold and hunger came up to one of the ants. “Please give me a grain or two from your store of corn to save my life," he said faintly.

“We worked day and night to get this corn in. Why should I give it to you?" asked the ant crossly. “Whatever were you doing all last summer when you should have been gathering your food?" 

“Oh! I didn’t have time for things like that," said the grasshopper. “I was far too busy singing to cany corn about." 

The ant laughed I unkindly. “In that case you can sing all winter as far as I am concerned," he said. 

And without another word he turned back to his work. 

Islam teaches us that we should help the less fortunate. But it also teaches us that we must work hard and not rely on the kindness of others for our daily needs.</li>

        <b class="n">Parable of the Pond of the Milk</b></center>
<div class="div">
    <ul>
    <li>Once there was a king who told some of his workers to dig a pond. Once the pond was dug, the king made an announcement to his people saying that one person from each household has to bring a glass of milk during the night and pour it into the pond. So, the pond should be full of milk by the morning. After receiving the order, everyone went home. 

One man prepared to take the milk during the night. He thought that since everyone will bring milk, he could just hide a glass of water and pour inside the pond. Because it will be dark at night, no one will notice. So he quickly went and poured the water in the pond and came back. In the morning, the king came to visit the pond and to his surprise the pond was only filled with water! What has happened is that everyone was thinking like the other man that “I don’t have to put the milk, someone else will do it." 
When it comes to help, do not think that others will take care of it. Rather, it starts from you, if you don’t do it, no one else will do it. So, change yourself. That will make the difference. </li>
